# E-Reader-with-NIght-Mode
In this project, we create a E-Reader-with-NIght-Mode with the help of HTML, CSS, and javascript.
This is not necessarily something I would normally do, or recommend! But on the occasion when my partner wants me to go to sleep before, I have found dark mode particularly useful while reading in the dark.
